      <h2>Assumption of Risk</h2>
      <p>
        I understand that Pilates exercises, including those performed on a Pilates reformer,
        involve physical activity that carries inherent risks of injury. I voluntarily choose to
        participate in Pilates sessions at Rose Pilates Studio, located at 236 Rue Camille Godard,
        33000 Bordeaux, France.
      </p>

      <h2>Health Declaration</h2>
      <p>
        I confirm that I am in good physical condition and have no medical conditions that would
        prevent me from safely participating in Pilates exercise sessions. I agree to inform
        Rose Pilates Studio of any changes to my health status, injuries, or medical conditions
        that may affect my ability to participate safely.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I am pregnant, post-operative, or have any chronic medical conditions, I agree to obtain
        written clearance from my physician before commencing sessions.
      </p>

      <h2>Release of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        I hereby release Rose Pilates Studio, its owner Rose Swiatecka Liljestrom, and any
        associated instructors from any and all liability for injuries, damages, or losses
        that may occur during or as a result of Pilates sessions, except in cases of proven
        negligence or wilful misconduct.
      </p>

      <h2>Personal Belongings</h2>
      <p>
        Rose Pilates Studio is not responsible for any personal belongings brought to the studio.
        Clients are advised to keep valuables secure at all times.
      </p>

      <h2>Photography and Recording</h2>
      <p>
        No photography, video recording, or audio recording is permitted during sessions without
        prior written consent from Rose Pilates Studio.
      </p>

      <h2>Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        By booking a session with Rose Pilates Studio, I acknowledge that I have read, understood,
        and agree to the terms outlined in this liability waiver. This waiver remains in effect for
        all future sessions at Rose Pilates Studio.
